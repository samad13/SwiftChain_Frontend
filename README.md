# SwiftChain - Frontend

**SwiftChain** is a Blockchain-Powered Logistics & Escrow Delivery Platform built on the Stellar blockchain. It connects customers, independent drivers, and logistics operators in a decentralized network, ensuring secure and transparent deliveries through smart contract escrow payments.

This repository (`SwiftChain-Frontend`) contains the frontend application built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Core Problem

Traditional logistics systems suffer from:

- Lack of trust between senders and independent drivers.
- High fees and slow payments for drivers.
- Limited access for small courier businesses and unbanked drivers.
- Inefficient cross-border settlement.

### Solution

SwiftChain introduces a decentralized logistics network where:

- **Smart Contracts** hold funds in escrow until delivery is verified.
- **Stellar Blockchain** facilitates fast, low-cost payments.
- **Independent Drivers** and small businesses can compete on a level playing field.

### How It Works

1.  **Sender** creates a delivery request and locks payment in an escrow smart contract.
2.  **Driver** accepts the delivery job.
3.  **Package** is transported to the destination.
4.  **Recipient** confirms receipt (or driver provides proof).
5.  **Escrow** automatically releases payment to the driver.

### Financial Inclusion Benefits

- Empowers independent drivers and small courier businesses.
- Provides access to global logistics markets for underserved regions (e.g., African markets).
- Enables cross-border merchants to settle payments instantly.

## 🎯 Target Market

- **African Logistics Markets**: Connecting informal transport sectors.
- **Cross-Border Merchants**: Facilitating trade between regions.
- **SME Businesses**: Affordable and reliable delivery options.
- **E-commerce Sellers**: Integrated delivery solutions.
- **Independent Delivery Drivers**: Gig economy opportunities with fair pay.

---

## 💰 Revenue Model

The platform generates revenue through:

- **Delivery Commission Fee**: Small percentage of each successful delivery.
- **Escrow Service Fee**: Fee for securing funds in smart contracts.
- **Enterprise Logistics Integration**: Premium API access for large logistics companies.
- **Cross-Border Settlement Fees**: Currency conversion and cross-border transaction fees.
- **Premium Fleet Management Tools**: Subscription-based tools for fleet operators.

## 🏗️ Platform Architecture

The SwiftChain platform consists of three main repositories:

1.  **SwiftChain-Frontend** (This Repo): Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS. Handles UI, user interaction, and client-side logic.
2.  **SwiftChain-Backend**: Express.js + Node.js + TypeScript + MongoDB. Manages off-chain data, user accounts, and API orchestration.
3.  **SwiftChain-SmartContract**: Stellar Soroban + Rust. Handles on-chain escrow logic, payments, and trustless verification.
